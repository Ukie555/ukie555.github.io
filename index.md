## PROJECT EXPERIENCE



## RESEARCH EXOERIENCE

**Research on system optimization of pharmaceutical logistics distribution center(01/2017 - 05/2017)**
_Li Ping, Gao Chen. Research on system optimization of pharmaceutical logistics distribution Center [N]. Journal of Modern Logistics of Beijing Union University. F426.72_

- Location of distribution center: Based on ant colony algorithm and combined with geographical factors, 2 pharmaceutical logistics distribution centers were selected to ensure the shortest transportation path to the 40 hospitals in Beijing
-Use AutoCAD to make warehouse maps of 2 medical distribution centers
- Based on the mileage saving algorithm, the confluence can be reduced by reducing the number of picking storage and the number of crossing tunnels. Improve order saturation of each collection order to optimize the pick path in the warehouse (C++)
- Based on the actual warehouse CAD, the algorithm in the warehouse is verified, and the picking path in the warehouse is optimized with FlexSim simulation software, which improves the efficiency by 13%
- AnyLogic simulation software was used to simulate two schemes for the pharmaceutical distribution path in Beijing: judging the transport path by the shortest path and the degree of drug emergency;

**Design of temperature and humidity monitoring system for grain storage environment based on wireless sensor network(09/2016-11/2016)**
_Gao Chen, ZHANG Siqi, ZHANG Rui, Wang Xiuying, LIU Jingyun. Design of Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System for Grain Storage Environment based on Wireless Sensor Network [J]. Internet of Things Technology. 2017(03). F324.9; TP274_

- System construction: The structure of temperature and humidity monitoring system for grain storage includes two parts: upper computer and lower computer. Based on the upper computer using Qt platform (C++) software system development, and connected with the database, data storage. The lower computer is composed of temperature and humidity wireless sensor nodes. The temperature and humidity data are collected and transmitted to the upper computer through the wireless sensor network
- The database platform was built through SQL Server and the software system of temperature and humidity monitoring system for finished grain was designed to improve the efficiency, real-time and accuracy of warehouse environmental monitoring
- Record and collect the data of grain temperature, and test it based on the storage environment;
