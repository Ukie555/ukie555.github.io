## PROJECT EXPERIENCE

#### JD Logistics - Digital Warehouse LV System Optimization (03/2021-07/2021)
**Project Description:**
- Based on the operation situation of the Supply Chain Department of JD, optimize the display of business volume data, refine the indicators of each operation link, develop the human efficiency base value, develop early warning strategies, and realize the online view of mobile APP.

**Project planning & execution:**

_As the business data system planner, deeply investigated the pain points of data use by the front-line managers and optimized the logic of data indicators and data presentation according to the requirements._

- Data screen design: Based on the business data display screen, the warning value logic is sorted out, which can monitor the human efficiency data, order clearance rate data in each link of the warehousing operation. Give suggestions and guidance to ensure the operation efficiency.
- Logical analysis of human efficiency data: Through different categories of warehouse and different first and second category planning rules, maintain the efficiency value of each operation post to control personnel attendance to reduce personnel costs.
- Abnormal monitoring: Display different links of orders that have not been operated for a long time to see the details of orders.

**Project revenue:**
- Launch data Kanban according to different positions and levels, increase the early-warning setting, and realize data decision-making.

#### Xiaomi - Construction of National Warehouse Operation Management System (10/2017 - 02/2019)
**Project description:**
- Due to the variable characteristics of Xiaomi logistics business, I made a comprehensive review of the warehousing operation process in this process.
