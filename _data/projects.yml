  With technology-driven business as the fundamental purpose, we use video networking technology to perform video backtracking on the packing table in the warehouse; use edge computing technology to monitor the throughput of the warehouse platform through video networking and JD Logistics' self-developed license plate recognition algorithm. The training set ranged from 10 to 2000, and the accuracy ranged from 0.5633 to 0.7220. 
  The model was applied to the JD Logistics digital platform to monitor vehicle throughput。

  desc: Programmed a Python crawler to extract warehouse business information, used Scikit-Learn to conduct correlation analysis. Through making a warehouse network planning plan, optimizing the warehouse operational process, and formulating warehouse KPIs management plan to build a Xiaomi Warehouse Information System.


- name: Development of Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System in Beijing Union University (09/2016 - 11/2016)
  link: download/monitoring_system.pdf
  img: images/sensor.png
  desc: Used the Qt platform (C++) and SQL Server to develop a software system to monitor temperature and humidity of finished grain. Then used the interpolation method to fit the data to obtain the temperature and humidity distribution, which improved the efficiency, real-time and accuracy of the system. The system can complete data collection and storage, which provided an effective monitoring method for the safe storage of finished grains.
