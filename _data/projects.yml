  desc: Extracted evaluation eigenvalues, and used two ensemble learning algorithms (Bagging, AdaBoost.M1) with SVM and Decision Tree to predict the service quality of Xiaomi logistics


- name: Promotional forecasting in Xiaomi Logistics Business @Xiaomi Logistics (07/2019 - 09/2019)
  link: download/xiaomi_promotional_forecasting.pdf
  img: images/miforecasting.png
  desc: Established regression models using Scikit-Learn based on historical sales data and past event to determine a seasonal time series model to describe the purchasing behavior of consumers


- name: National Warehousing Network Planning @Xiaomi Logistics (07/2018 - 05/2020)
  link: download/xiaomi_network_planning.pdf
  img: images/minetwork.png
  desc: Performed cluster analysis on regional order data, constructed a feature vector to represent customer distribution and made plans to ensure that more than 95% of orders can be delivered the next day, and then selected warehouse locations to increase commodity coverage.


- name: National Xiaomi Warehouse Information System Management @Xiaomi Logistics (03/2018 - 05/2020)
  link: download/xiaomi_warehouse_system.pdf
  img: images/milogistics.png
  desc: Programmed a Python crawler to extract warehouse business information, used Scikit-Learn to conduct correlation analysis. Through making a warehouse network planning plan, optimizing the warehouse operational process, and formulating warehouse KPIs management plan to build a Xiaomi Warehouse Information System.


- name: Analysis and Optimization of Operational Process of Pharmaceutical Logistics Distribution Center @Beijing Union University (01/2017 - 05/2017)
  link: download/buu_logistics_dc.pdf
  img: images/buulogistics.jpg
  desc: Choose 2 out of 67 distribution centers in Beijing as the pharmaceutical logistics distribution center and used AutoCAD and SketchUp to create 3D warehouse drawings. In the warehouse picking strategy, the savings algorithm is used to form 62 order sets from 2057 orders randomly selected in Beijing, and the ant colony algorithm is used to optimize the picking path. The main method used in the distribution process is to use the traveling salesman problem (TSP) algorithm based on heuristics to plan the path of the pharmaceutical distribution process. Finally, the simulation software FlexSim and AnyLogic were used to verify the algorithm scheme.


- name: Development of Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System @Beijing Union University (09/2016 - 11/2016)
  link: download/monitoring_system.pdf
  img: images/sensor.png
  desc: Used the Qt platform (C++) and SQL Server to develop a software system to monitor temperature and humidity of finished grain. Then used the interpolation method to fit the data to obtain the temperature and humidity distribution, which improved the efficiency, real-time and accuracy of the system. The system can complete data collection and storage, which provided an effective monitoring method for the safe storage of finished grains.
